#  Nevada Gambling Commission Approves Use of Generator in Oregon Casino

The Nevada Gambling Commission has approved the use of a generator by the Oregon casino in case of a power outage. The decision comes as the result of an emergency meeting held on Thursday, January 10th.

According to Commission Chair Tony Alamo, Jr., "the situation in Oregon is unique. We understand that the casino there is currently using a generator to provide backup power, and we want to do everything we can to support their efforts."

Oregon's main grid is supplied by PacifiCorp, which operates at 60 Hertz. The casino's generator runs at 50 Hertz, meaning that it cannot provide continuous power to the facility. The Commission's approval allows the casino to use the generator as a backup power source in case of a power outage.

This isn't the first time that Nevada has come to the aid of another state's gaming industry. In late 2017, the Nevada Gaming Control Board approved a waiver for Mississippi casinos affected by Hurricane Nate. The Board allowed the casinos to remain open past their regular closing time in order to allow patrons enough time to evacuate.

#  No Power, No Problem: Oregon Casino to Use Generator for Continuity

The Spirit Mountain Casino, located in Grande Ronde, Oregon, is planning to use a generator as a backup power source in case of an emergency. The casino is in the process of installing the generator and expects it to be up and running by the end of the year.

The decision was made in response to a statewide power outage that affected nearly 1 million people last December. The Spirit Mountain Casino was one of the businesses that lost power during the outage.

“We want our customers and team members to know that we are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience at all times,” said casino spokesperson Kera Abraham. “Having a back-up generator will allow us to continue operations if there is another power outage.”

As part of its emergency preparedness plan, the casino has also stockpiled fuel for the generator and has arranged for additional generators in case of a prolonged power outage.

The Spirit Mountain Casino isn’t the only business in Oregon making preparations for potential power outages. Pacific Power, which provides electricity to much of the state, says that it is preparing for outages that could last up to several weeks.

#  $2 Million Spent on Generator for Oregon's gambling Resort

A $2 million natural gas-fired generator is coming to The Mill Casino-Hotel & RV Park in North Bend, Oregon.

The 168-foot-tall structure will be the most visible addition to the casino grounds in years, said Michael Deen, executive director of the property.

The new generator will serve as a back-up power source for the casino, which has been without one since late last year. The original generator failed because of a faulty part, Deen said.

"It was very unfortunate that we lost our power last year," he said. "But this new generator is going to be a big asset to us."

The Mill Casino is owned by the Coos Bay Indian Tribe. It's one of the largest employers in Coos County, with about 500 people on its payroll.

#  New Generator Keeps Oregon's Casino Afloat During Outages

When Oregon's casino suffered an unexpected outage, the back-up generator kicked in and saved the day.

The backup generator has proved its worth many times over since it was installed, but the latest outage was a doozy. It lasted for three days, and without the backup generator running, the casino would have been forced to close its doors.

"Our backup generator is a lifesaver," said one casino employee. "We can't thank it enough."

The casino is just one of many businesses in Oregon that rely on backup generators to stay afloat during outages. Hospitals, grocery stores, and even small businesses have all come to rely on generators in order to keep running during power outages.

And with more and more severe weather hitting the area, it's no wonder that businesses are turning to generators in droves. In fact, according to a recent study, the number of businesses that rely on generators has doubled in the past five years.

This increase can be attributed to a number of factors, including cost savings, improved reliability, and increased awareness about the importance of backup generators. Businesses are also becoming more savvy about the different types of generators available, which has led to an increase in sales of diesel and natural gas generators.

So if you're looking for a way to keep your business running during outages, a backup generator may be just what you need.
