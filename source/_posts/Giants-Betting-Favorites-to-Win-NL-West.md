#  Giants Betting Favorites to Win NL West

The San Francisco Giants are coming off a disappointing 2017 season in which they finished third in the NL West with an 82-80 record. However, the Giants are still considered the favorites to win the NL West in 2018.

San Francisco's lineup is led by All-Star catcher Buster Posey and outfielder Hunter Pence. The Giants also have some young talent in second baseman Joe Panik, shortstop Brandon Crawford, and third baseman Pablo Sandoval.

San Francisco's starting pitching is led by Madison Bumgarner and Johnny Cueto. Other pitchers in the rotation include Jeff Samardzija, Matt Moore, and Ty Blach.

The Giants bullpen features closer Mark Melancon, as well as setup man Hunter Strickland and lefty specialist Josh Osich.

Despite their inconsistent play last year, the Giants remain the favorite to win the NL West in 2018. They have a strong lineup and pitching staff, and should be able to compete for a playoff berth.

#  Dodgers the Underdog in NL West Odds

The Dodgers started the season as one of the favorites to win the National League West, but after a slow start, they are now considered the underdog.

At +275, the Dodgers have the third-best odds to win the division, behind the Diamondbacks (+190) and Rockies (+250).

The Dodgers' odds to win the World Series have also slipped, from +650 at the start of the season to +850 now.

Despite their early-season struggles, there's still plenty of time for the Dodgers to turn things around.

After all, they did win the division last year despite losing their first eight games.

The Dodgers will need to play better baseball if they want to win their sixth division title in a row, but with Clayton Kershaw and Corey Seager leading the way, they certainly have a chance.

#  Padres Poised to Make a Run at NL West Crown

The Padres had a busy offseason, upgrading their roster with the additions of Eric Hosmer, Wil Myers, and Greg Garcia. They also added some depth to their pitching staff by signing Tyson Ross and Clayton Richard.

With this improved roster, the Padres are poised to make a run at the NL West crown.

Eric Hosmer is coming off a career year with the Royals in which he hit .318 with 25 home runs and 104 RBI. He will be a welcomed addition to the Padres lineup and should provide some much needed power.

Wil Myers is also coming off a career year in which he hit .286 with 28 home runs and 94 RBI. He provides another dangerous option in the Padres lineup.

The pitching staff also looks much improved this season. Tyson Ross had an injury plagued 2017 season, but is healthy now and should be able to bounce back. Clayton Richard had a very good 2017 season, posting a 3.26 ERA in 32 starts. The rest of the rotation is filled out by young starters Luis Perdomo and Dinelson Lamet, who both showed promise last season.

The bullpen also looks strong with Brad Hand and Kirby Yates leading the way. Hand has been one of the best relievers in baseball over the past few seasons, while Yates emerged as one of the top closers in baseball last season.

Overall, the Padres have made some significant upgrades to their roster and are poised to make a run at the NL West crown this season.

#  Rockies Look to Jump Back into NL West Race 

The Colorado Rockies have been one of the most disappointing teams in the National League this season. Heading into the All-Star break, they held a record of 34-49, which was good for last place in the NL West. However, they have shown some signs of life since then, winning six of their last ten games.

Now, they will look to make a push back into the race for the NL West crown. They currently sit seven games back of first place, but there is still plenty of time for them to make up ground.

One of the main reasons for their turnaround has been the play of Nolan Arenado. He is hitting .340 with 18 homers and 56 RBIs on the season. He has been especially hot lately, batting .471 over his last ten games.

If Arenado can continue to hit like he has been, it will go a long way towards helping the Rockies win some games down the stretch. Other key contributors for Colorado include Charlie Blackmon and Trevor Story. Both players are batting over .300 on the year and have been big contributors offensively.

On the mound, they will rely on Jon Gray and German Marquez to lead them to victory. Gray has struggled at times this season, but he is coming off a strong outing against San Francisco in which he allowed just one run in six innings. Marquez has also been solid this year, posting a 10-5 record with a 3.78 ERA.

If Colorado can get strong pitching performances from their starters and continued production from Arenado and Blackmon, they have a chance to make a late run at the division title.

#  Could the AZ Diamondbacks Surprise in the NL West?

The Arizona Diamondbacks surprised a lot of people last season by winning the NL West division title. With most of their key players back in 2018, could they surprise again and win the division this year?

First baseman Paul Goldschmidt is the heart and soul of the Diamondbacks. He led the team in both home runs (36) and RBIs (120) last season, and he is a perennial MVP candidate. Outfielders A.J. Pollock and David Peralta are also key offensive players for Arizona, as both hit over .290 last year.

On the mound, Zack Greinke is coming off another strong season. The veteran right-hander had a 3.20 ERA and 202 strikeouts in 212 innings pitched last year. Robbie Ray was also impressive for the Diamondbacks last season, posting a 2.89 ERA and 218 strikeouts in 173 innings pitched.

Arizona’s bullpen could be an issue this season. Closer Fernando Rodney had an up-and-down 2017, and setup man Archie Bradley was also shaky at times. If Rodney and Bradley can pitch effectively this year, the Diamondbacks should be in good shape to contend for the NL West title.

All things considered, the Diamondbacks look like they have a good chance to repeat as division champions in 2018. They have a strong lineup top to bottom, and their starting pitching is among the best in baseball. If their bullpen can hold its own, there’s no reason why Arizona can’t make another playoff run this year.
