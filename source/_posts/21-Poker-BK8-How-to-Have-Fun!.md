If you are looking for a fun and exciting new way to spend your time, look no further than 21 Poker BK8! This game offers all the excitement of traditional poker, but with a unique and engaging twist.

21 Poker BK8 is played using a deck of 52 cards. The goal is to create the best five-card poker hand possible. Before the cards are dealt, each player places an ante bet. The dealer then deals two cards face down to each player, and two cards face up to the dealer.

The players then have the opportunity to either call or fold. If they call, they must place a bet equal to their original ante bet. If they fold, they forfeit their ante bet and are out of the hand.

The dealer then reveals the final card, which is also turned over face up. The player with the best five-card poker hand wins the pot. If there is a tie, the pot is divided equally among the players who tied.
