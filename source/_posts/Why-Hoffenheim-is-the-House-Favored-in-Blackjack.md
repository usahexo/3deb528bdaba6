#  Hoffenheim's Secret to Beating Blackjack

It's no secret that casino operators love Hoffenheim. The small German club has a knack for consistently beating the house at blackjack. What's their secret?

One thing Hoffenheim does is use a blackjack basic strategy chart to guide their betting. This involves sticking to certain playing decisions based on the cards that have already been dealt. For instance, if the player has an Ace and a six, they would hit if the next card was a two or less, and stand if it was a three or more.
