#  Study Shows That Closing Online Gambling Bill Would Be Huge Mistake

A recent study has shown that closing down online gambling would be a huge mistake, with the country losing out on billions of dollars in revenue.

The study, conducted by the University of Sydney, found that the closure of online gambling would lead to a significant loss in jobs and tax revenue. In fact, it is estimated that the country would lose out on $1.8 billion in revenue every year.

This would translate into a loss of 4,700 jobs each year, as well as a reduction in tax revenue of $113 million annually.

This research is timely given that the Federal Government is currently considering whether or not to close down online gambling. The government has previously stated that it wants to close down online gambling because it is harmful to society and vulnerable people.

However, this new research shows that this is not the case. In fact, the closure of online gambling would have a negative impact on the economy and result in job losses.

It is clear that the Federal Government needs to reconsider its position on online gambling and instead focus on ways to regulate and improve this industry.

#  How To Close Online Gambling Bill - The Right Way

There are pros and cons to everything in life and that definitely includes the issue of online gambling. Some people feel very strongly that it should be legalized and regulated, while others vehemently oppose it due to concerns about addiction, underage gambling and organized crime. Here we will explore both sides of the argument in order to come up with a reasoned solution.

First let’s take a look at the benefits of legalizing online gambling. The main advantage is that it would be regulated and taxed, bringing in much-needed revenue for state governments. It would also create jobs in the gaming industry, which is currently a $41 billion sector. And finally, it would give people a legal way to gamble if they choose to do so.

On the other hand, there are some serious risks associated with online gambling. Chief among them is addiction, which can ruin lives and families. Another concern is underage gambling, which can lead young people down a path of ruin. And then there are the concerns about organized crime, which could infiltrate the gaming industry if it were legalized.

So what’s the answer? Given all of the pros and cons, it’s probably best to legalize online gambling but with strict regulations in place. This would include setting an age limit for gambling, preventing people from betting more than they can afford to lose and ensuring that gaming companies are reputable and honest. It would also be important to have strong enforcement mechanisms in place so that any breaches of the regulations can be quickly addressed.

In conclusion, while there are risks associated with legalizing online gambling, these can be minimized by putting in place strong regulations. On balance, we believe that the benefits outweigh the risks and that online gambling should be legalized

#  Feds Urged To Close Online Gambling Bill loophole

The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is being urged by a coalition of state attorneys general to close a loophole in the new online gambling bill that would allow overseas operators to continue to serve American customers.

The group, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General James Cole on Thursday urging the DOJ to “quickly issue regulations that will close the loophole”.

The new online gambling bill, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in October, legalizes online poker and casinos but bars companies from taking bets from American customers unless they are physically located within the US borders.

However, overseas companies have been able to get around this by setting up shop on Native American reservations within the US. The DOJ has said it will not pursue legal action against these companies as they are operating within tribal sovereignty.

Schneiderman said in a statement that this loophole “creates an uneven and inconsistent playing field” and called on the DOJ to act quickly to close it.

This is not the first time that Schneiderman has voiced his concerns over the new online gambling bill. In November he wrote a letter to Cole expressing his concerns that the legislation would leave New Yorkers “at a distinct disadvantage”.

#  Senators Vow To Close Online Gambling Bill loopholes

Only days after the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) was signed into law, a number of Senators have come forward with plans to close potential loopholes in the new legislation.

The UIGEA, which is designed to prohibit banks and financial institutions from processing transactions involving illegal online gambling, has come under fire from a number of sources who argue that the bill is too vague and could lead to many unintended consequences.

Earlier this week, a group of Senators led by Harry Reid (D-NV) announced their plans to introduce a new bill that would clarify the language of the UIGEA while also strengthening enforcement measures. The proposed bill would also exclude horse racing and state lotteries from the list of activities covered by the UIGEA.

In a statement released on Monday, Reid said "The intent of this legislation is clear - we want to stop criminals from gambling online, but we also don't want to hurt responsible Americans who are engaged in legal online activities."

Reid's efforts were quickly endorsed by other members of the Senate, including Charles Schumer (D-NY), Jon Corzine (D-NJ), and Robert Menendez (D-NJ). Schumer said "It's important that we close any potential loopholes in this law so that it can have its intended effect - shutting down illegal online gambling operations."

Despite these assurances, some industry insiders remain concerned about the potential impact of the UIGEA on legitimate businesses. In an interview with Reuters, Steve Baker, vice president of the Casino Association of America, said "Some people are going to get hurt in this. It's not going to be pretty."

#  Nevada Officials Concerned About Closing Online Gambling Bill

Leaders in the Nevada gambling industry are concerned that a bill to ban online gambling will pass in the state legislature. The proposed legislation, which was introduced last week, would prohibit all forms of internet betting, including poker.

The measure was proposed by Assemblyman Jim Wheeler, who said it is needed to protect the interests of casino owners and their employees. "We just can't have people sitting in their pajamas at home playing poker and making money off of our casinos," Wheeler said.

Nevada is the only state that currently allows online poker, and the industry is worth an estimated $200 million per year. The bill would not affect other forms of online gambling such as blackjack or slots.

 Supporters of the bill say that it is necessary to protect Nevada's gambling industry from competition from other states. They argue that many people who live in Nevada now gamble online, instead of going to casinos.

Opponents of the bill say that it will hurt the state's economy, and cost jobs. They also argue that it is unconstitutional, because it interferes with people's right to gamble online.

The bill has not yet been scheduled for a vote, but it is expected to face strong opposition in the legislature.
