#  Suns Use Moneyline Strategy to Pick up Second Straight Win

Phoenix Suns managed to pull off another victory, this time against the Dallas Mavericks, as they continue their search for a playoff spot. The Suns have largely been relying on their moneyline strategy in order to win games, and it seems to be working so far.

 Phoenix Suns – +120 Moneyline

The Phoenix Suns were able to secure their second consecutive win by beating the Dallas Mavericks 122-105 on the road. This was a much-needed win for the Suns, who are currently chasing the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.

 Devin Booker led the way for Phoenix with 36 points on 14-of-24 shooting, while TJ Warren also chipped in with 24 points. Meanwhile, DeAndre Jordan had a big game for Dallas with 23 points and 18 rebounds.

Despite the big game from Jordan, it was not enough to stop the Suns from picking up the victory. This was due in large part to Phoenix’s efficient offense, which shot 51.2% from the field and 40.0% from three-point range.

The Suns will now look to build on this victory as they continue their playoff push. They will next face off against the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday before taking on the Golden State Warriors later in the week.

#  Phoenix Suns Cover the Point Spread Against the Kings

The Phoenix Suns were 5.5 point favorites against the Sacramento Kings, and they covered the point spread with a final score of 111-104. Devin Booker led the Suns in scoring with 30 points on 11-of-21 shooting. De'Aaron Fox led the Kings in scoring with 28 points on 12-of-23 shooting.

The Suns started the game off hot, scoring 11 points in the first three minutes of the game. The Kings were able to keep it close for most of the game, but the Suns pulled away in the fourth quarter. Booker was especially impressive in the fourth quarter, scoring 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting.

This was a much-needed win for the Suns, who are now 2-1 on their five-game road trip. They will next face off against the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night.

#  Suns Ride Hot Hand of Booker to Take Down Denver Nuggets

In a matchup of two of the top teams in the Western Conference, the Phoenix Suns (14-7) rode the hot hand of Devin Booker to take down the Denver Nuggets (15-7) 127-116. Booker exploded for 46 points on 17-of-32 shooting, including 6-of-13 from 3-point range, to go along with 6 assists and 5 rebounds.

The Suns led by as many as 25 points in the game, but the Nuggets made a late push to cut it to single digits. But Phoenix was able to hold on for the victory.

TJ Warren added 21 points and 8 rebounds for Phoenix, while Jamal Murray led Denver with 28 points on 10-of-22 shooting. Nikola Jokic had a triple double (19 points, 14 rebounds, 11 assists), but it wasn’t enough for Denver to overcome Booker’s big night.

#  NBA Betting Preview: Phoenix Suns at Memphis Grizzlies

Wednesday evening features a matchup of two teams on complete opposite ends of the spectrum in the NBA. The Phoenix Suns (4-22) will visit the Memphis Grizzlies (15-8) as massive 14.5-point underdogs, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.

Phoenix has lost its last four games and is currently in last place in the Western Conference. Memphis, on the other hand, is riding a six-game winning streak and is in fourth place in the conference.

The Suns have been one of the worst offensive teams in the league this season, averaging just 97.9 points per game, while ranking near the bottom of the league in shooting percentage (43 percent) and three-pointers made per game (8.2).

Conversely, Memphis has been one of the most efficient offensive teams in the NBA, averaging 108.4 points per game while shooting 46 percent from the field and 37 percent from three-point range.

The Grizzlies have also been solid defensively, ranking fourth in opponents’ points per game (97.1) and holding their opponents to a league-low 43 percent shooting from the field. Phoenix ranks 26th in scoring defense (110.1 points allowed per game), and 26th in opponent shooting percentage (47 percent).

Phoenix will be without standout guard Devin Booker for Wednesday’s contest as he continues to nurse a hamstring injury. Booker was averaging 24 points per game prior to getting injured and is expected to miss at least another week. Memphis All-Star center Marc Gasol is listed as questionable with an illness but is expected to play barring any setbacks.

Given their offensive woes and significant injuries, it’s no surprise that oddsmakers have pegged Phoenix as 14.5-point underdogs ahead of Wednesday night’s matchup against Memphis. With Booker sidelined and few other scoring options on the roster, it could be another long night for Suns fans when they visit FedExForum to face off against the streaking Grizzlies
