#  What is Venetian Rain?

When you think of Venice, Italy, what comes to mind? Gondolas? The canals? The beautiful architecture? If you're like most people, the rain probably doesn't cross your mind. But in fact, Venice is a city that can experience a lot of rainfall. And when it does rain, it's known as Venetian rain.

What is Venetian rain? Technically speaking, Venetian rain refers to any type of precipitation that falls in Venice. However, it's commonly used to describe light rain that falls in the city for an extended period of time. This type of rain is often accompanied by low temperatures and high humidity, which can make things very wet and cold.

Venetian rain can be a bit of a nuisance for locals and tourists alike. It often leads to flooding in certain areas of the city, and it can make getting around difficult. However, many people consider it to be one of the charms of Venice. After all, what's more romantic than strolling through the city streets while it's raining?

If you're planning on visiting Venice during the winter months, be prepared for some Venetian rain. It's important to dress appropriately and bring an umbrella with you. And don't let the weather deter you from experiencing all that this amazing city has to offer!

#  What are the Venetian Rain Game?

The Venetian Rain Game is a strategy game that is played with 3-4 players. The game can be played with two different goals, either to capture the most raincoats of the other players or to be the last player with a coat. The game is played on a rectangular board with a different color for each player. There are also six raincoats, three in each color. The game starts with all the raincoats in the center of the board and each player has three pieces, one in each corner of the board.

To play, each player moves their piece in turn. Pieces can move either one or two spaces, and they can jump over other pieces. If a player captures another player's piece, they take one of that player's raincoats. If a player captures all of another player's pieces, they take that player's last raincoat. The game ends when one player has no pieces left or when all the raincoats have been captured. The player with the most raincoats at the end wins the game.

#  What is the New Zealand?

The New Zealand is an island country located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is made up of two main islands - the North Island and the South Island - and Stewart Island, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of the South Island. The country is around 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) long from north to south, with a coastline of about 15,134 kilometers (9,404 miles).

New Zealand has a temperate maritime climate. The North Island has a rainier and milder climate than the South Island. The average temperature ranges from 8oC to 16oC (46oF to 61oF), although temperatures can drop below 0oC (32oF) in the winter months and reach above 30oC (86oF) in summer. Annual rainfall varies greatly, from over 4,000 millimeters (157 inches) on the West Coast of the South Island to less than 600 millimeters (24 inches) on the East Coast of the North Island. New Zealand's long coastline and numerous sheltered bays, rivers and lakes also make it a popular destination for yachting and sailing.

The indigenous Māori people were the first settlers in New Zealand. They arrived over 1,000 years ago from eastern Polynesia. British settlement began in 1788 with the arrival of Captain James Cook during his first voyage round the world. Permanent European settlement began in 1840 when Britain annexed New Zealand as a colony.

New Zealand became an independent country within the British Commonwealth in 1931. It declared war on Nazi Germany shortly after Britain's declaration of war in 1939, and participated in many campaigns including those in North Africa, Italy, Greece and Normandy. After World War II ended, New Zealand joined the United Nations (UN) and signed the Treaty of Waitangi which recognized Māori land rights. In 1947 New Zealand granted women parliamentary voting rights - becoming one of the first countries in the world to do so - and elected its first woman MP later that year.

Since becoming a sovereign nation, New Zealand has developed into a modern industrialized country with a prosperous free-market economy reliant on trade. Agriculture still plays an important role in the economy with exports including meat, dairy products, wool and fruit. Manufacturing accounts for around 16% of GDP while tourism is also a significant sector generating nearly $11 billion annually - 9% of GDP - making it one of NZ's largest export earners
