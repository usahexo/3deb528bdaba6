#  Super Sunny Fruits Illinois Gambling Revenue Up

The Illinois gambling industry continued to grow in 2017, with revenues from casinos, racetracks and other gambling operations reaching a record high of $2.48 billion.

The Illinois Gaming Board released its annual report on Wednesday, showing that the increase was driven by growth in the state’s casino sector. Revenues from casinos grew by 5.8 percent last year, to $1.53 billion.

That was boosted in part by the opening of two new casinos in the Chicago area: Rivers Casino in Des Plaines and Harrah’s Joliet Hotel and Casino. The Joliet casino is located just south of Chicago, while the Des Plaines casino is about 25 miles northwest of downtown Chicago.

Slot machine revenues were up 6.7 percent at casinos, to $1.12 billion, while table game revenues were up 2 percent, to $341 million.

The growth in casino revenues was offset somewhat by declines at racetracks and other gambling operations, including video gaming terminals (VGTs) outside of casinos. Revenues from racetracks declined by 5 percent last year, to $301 million, while VGT revenues fell by 3 percent, to $215 million.

Nevertheless, net gambling revenue — which includes revenue from all types of gambling operations — reached a new high of $2.48 billion in 2017, up 3 percent from 2016 levels. That translates into an increase of more than $72 million in gambling revenue for the state government.

#  Illinois Ban on Sports Gambling Continues to Bleed Revenue

 * For the third consecutive year, Illinois’s ban on sports gambling has cost the state an estimated $20 million in potential revenue.

* According to a recent study by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, legalizing sports betting could generate as much as $370 million in new revenue for the state each year.

* The study also estimates that legalizing sports betting would create between 2,800 and 4,600 jobs in Illinois.

* Despite these findings, lawmakers in Springfield have shown no interest in repealing the state’s ban on sports gambling.

* This lack of interest is puzzling, given that neighboring states like Indiana and Iowa have both legalized sports betting and seen significant economic benefits as a result.

* It’s time for legislators in Springfield to recognize the benefits of legalizing sports gambling and act accordingly.

#  Could Legalized Sports Gambling in Illinois Help Address the State's Budget Crisis?

The state of Illinois is facing a budget crisis, with a projected budget deficit of $6.2 billion for the fiscal year 2019. One potential solution that has been proposed is to legalize sports gambling in the state.

So far, 11 states have legalized sports gambling, and it has generated over $1.8 billion in revenue. In Illinois, legalizing sports gambling could bring in an estimated $200 million per year in revenue. This could help to address the state's budget crisis and help to fund important programs and services.

Legalizing sports gambling would also create jobs and generate economic activity in the state. It would provide a new source of revenue for casinos and other businesses that cater to gamblers. And it would give Illinois residents another option for spending their entertainment dollars.

There are some who oppose legalizing sports gambling, citing concerns about addiction and crime. However, these concerns can be addressed through regulation and enforcement. Overall, legalizing sports gambling appears to be a promising solution for addressing Illinois' budget crisis.

#  Is it Time to Legalize Sports Gambling in Illinois?

Opponents of legalizing sports gambling in Illinois say that it would lead to increased addiction and crime rates. They also argue that it would be harmful to the families of those who gamble excessively.
